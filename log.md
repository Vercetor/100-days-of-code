# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 1, 2017. Monday
**Today's Progress**: started 100 days of code. Deliberate practice.


### Day 1: May 2, Tuesday

**FCC Progress**: completed half of the "HTML5 & CSS" excercises on FCC.

**FCC questions and frustrations** : None so far. I have experience in HTML and CSS, So im waiting till we hit jquery/JS.



### Day 2: May 3rd, Wednesday

**FCC Progress**: Finished all of my HTML5 and CSS3 on FCC. Started Bootstrap. Had fun with my html and css stuff. It was really easy but very entertaining and refreshing to catch back up on.

**FCC questions and frustrations** : My curiousity has always been why are there so many overrides in HTML and css. Like with c++ usually a compiler catches many things, but with html and css you can constantly override and things can be placed in html or CSS.
with HTML and CSS i can add multiple classes, each overriding the last. I had to do so much debugging during my web design because I didnt understand why certain things were overriding others.
