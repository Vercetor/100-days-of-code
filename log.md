# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 1, 2017. Monday
**Today's Progress**: started 100 days of code. Deliberate practice.


### Day 1: May 2, Tuesday

**FCC Progress**: completed half of the "HTML5 & CSS" excercises on FCC.

**FCC questions and frustrations** : None so far. I have experience in HTML and CSS, So im waiting till we hit jquery/JS.



### Day 2: May 3rd, Wednesday

**FCC Progress**: Finished all of my HTML5 and CSS3 on FCC. Started Bootstrap. Had fun with my html and css stuff. It was really easy but very entertaining and refreshing to catch back up on.

**FCC questions and frustrations** : My curiousity has always been why are there so many overrides in HTML and css. Like with c++ usually a compiler catches many things, but with html and css you can constantly override and things can be placed in html or CSS.
with HTML and CSS i can add multiple classes, each overriding the last. I had to do so much debugging during my web design because I didnt understand why certain things were overriding others.



### Day 3: May 4th, Thursday

**FCC Progress**: I was unable to upload my work yesterday due to one of my kids needing to go to the hospital. I got stuck with the arrays for awhile. I finally but slowly progressed through it after class

**FCC questions and frustrations** : arrays bother me in JS. I think I prefer C++ arrays.


### Day 4: May 5th, Friday

**FCC Progress**: Today I was able to work through building JS objects. This seem almost over complicated? Maybe it was my bias torwards C++.

**FCC questions and frustrations** :  I am still having trouble accessing objects variables. I will try again tomorrow to thoroughly complete it all.


### Day 5: May 6th, Saturday

**FCC Progress**:  I actually got really stuck on these last few questions, so I have just been going backwards on my FCC coding and working through the problems again to refresh my memory.  I couldnt move forward and I wanted to progress so I stopped trying to kill myself over work I didnt understand and worked backwards.

**FCC questions and frustrations** : JS has been frustrating me with its syntax. I guess im partial to C++. A lot of it makes more sense, but that is also because I already have spent so much time on it. I will continue to work through the problems I already completed to move on.

### Day 7: May 8th, Monday

**FCC Progress**: Took the day to finish my HTML final. I made a 9 page website final for intro to internet with Javascript though! I used some of what i learned in created a really cool splash page. 

**FCC questions and frustrations** : I feel like I dont have enough time to study, and do my HTML final, and Be mentally prepared for my OOP final. I have been working more on my C++ then my JS, even though i understand they both can be applied both ways, I feel like I can never study enough with my short term memory problems.


### Day 8: May 9th, 

**FCC Progress**:  Worked through the problems I have already completed again on FCC cause I was stuck again. I think my brain is over worked and only thinking about C++ and my HTML final. I completed my HTML final, sacrificing time on my JS. Had to be done, having 2 teen age kids, a massive 400 point HTML final, and a masssive OOP final are hard to balance. I study all I can, but OOP feels overwhelming sometimes, so I am trying to apply it else where. I have also been creating a video and a physics program on the side to help me better understand my C++.

**FCC questions and frustrations** : I feel like I have no time at all to balance all of my studies. If I hadn't finished my other classes early, I have no idea how I would be doing right now. Thankfully I completed almost everything months ago, except my final. Its really frustrating when i spend hours every week studying, and I sit down in front of my computer and I feel completely lost. my anxiety destroys my brains thinking process. But Thankfully I touched up my HTML final and I think it looks amazing. I know most of it is way beyong what I was doing in class, I do have a lot of experience in HTML from high school. Now hopefully I can free up some brain power for my big final. I am very nervous because I really want to pass my class. I do not want to fail, I do everything I can to bust my butt in OOP, but C++ ios very difficult, but even though I am having a hard time, I do notice things are coming more easily to me now. Over the summer I will continue my 100 days of coding, and practice on perfecting my C++ that way I can prepare a good folder to show off for my interviews and help myself understand everything better.
